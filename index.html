    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Mayukha Sripathi and I am currently a senior attending Thomas Edison CTE High School.
     Throughout my high school years, I have been involved with Web Design/Development for almost three years now which I truly enjoy.
     My portfolio contains many projects I have completed throughout my Senior year to showcase what I have learned. </p>

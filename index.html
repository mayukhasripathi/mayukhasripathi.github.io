        <h3><a href="https://mayukhasripathi.github.io/Harry-Styles-Live-on-Tour/">Gallery Project</a></h3>
        <p> For this gallery project, we used our knowledge on arrays, for each loops, the .push and the .length method in order to create a picture gallery. </p>
        
        <h3><a href="https://mayukhasripathi.github.io/Which-Outer-Banks-Character-Are-You/">Character Quiz</a></h3>
        <p> In order to create a personalized quiz game, I used what I learned about if else statements, else-if conditional statements and compound conditional statements using "&&" and || to do so.</p>
        
        <h3><a href="https://mayukhasripathi.github.io/Random-Quote-Generator/">Quote Generator</a></h3>
        <p>This random quote generator was created by the use of arrays, math.random() methods and jQuery click functions. </p>
